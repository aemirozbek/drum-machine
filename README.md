# Drum Machine

This is a simple drum machine application built using React. It allows users to play various drum sounds by clicking on virtual drum pads or pressing corresponding keys on their keyboard. The application also provides volume control and the ability to switch between different sets of drum sounds.

## Installation

1. To run the Drum Machine locally, follow these steps:
1.Clone the repository or download the source code.
1.Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
1.Install the dependencies by running the command: npm install
1.Start the development server with the command: npm start
1.Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to see the application running.

## Usage
The drum machine interface is divided into two main sections: the drum pad area and the options area.

### Drum Pad Area
The drum pad area consists of nine drum pads arranged in a grid-like pattern. Each drum pad represents a specific drum sound and is associated with a key on the keyboard. The keys mapped to the drum pads are as follows:

- Q, W, E
- A, S, D
- Z, X, C

To play a drum sound, you can either click on the drum pad using your mouse or press the corresponding key on your keyboard.

### Options Area

The options area provides additional functionality for the drum machine.

#### Display
The display area shows the name of the currently played drum sound or any other relevant information. It updates dynamically as you interact with the drum pads.

#### Volume Control
The volume control slider allows you to adjust the volume of the drum sounds. Drag the slider left or right to decrease or increase the volume, respectively.

#### Bank Switch
The bank switch toggle allows you to switch between two sets of drum sounds. By default, the drum machine loads the first set of drum sounds (links1). Clicking on the toggle will switch to the second set of drum sounds (links2), and vice versa.
